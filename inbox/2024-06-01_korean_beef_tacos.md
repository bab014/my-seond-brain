## Instructions
### Cooking the meat
> Multiple ways to cook the meat
- Smoked on a charcoal grill
- In a slow cooker
- In the oven, preferably in a dutch oven
> for the purposes of the instructions will use the slow cooker method since this will be the easiest of the 3
1. Season the meat with salt and let sit for up to a half an hour
2. Season the meat with the bbq rub, ground ginger and sesame mix
3. Sear the meat on a hot pan until all sides of the meat have a solid crust
4. While searing, bring the beef broth to a boil
5. Pour half the boiling broth into the slow cooker, then place the seared beef on top of the liquid. Pour the remaining liquid into the cooker and any excess seasoning that didn't stick to the meat
6. Cook on low for at least 8 hours, up to 10 to achieve maximum tenderness
7. Place cooked meat into a heat safe bowl and shred with 2 forks, or with hands if cool enough
### Preparing the Bulgogi Sauce
1. Add all the ingredients, except the honey, into a pot and whisk until fully incorporated. Bring to a boil
2. Add in the honey and reduce to a simmer stirring occasionally
3. Let simmer until reduced by about a third and coats the back of a spoon. Around 20 to 30 mins
4. Remove from heat and let fully cool
### Making the Taco Sauce
1. Add all the taco sauce ingredients into a bowl and whisk
2. For a thinner sauce add more lime juice
### Preparing the Tacos
