# Tips For Cooking Chicken

### Before You Cook
- Marinate the chicken
    - ***My Chipotle marinade***
        1. Can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce
        2. 1 lime
        3. Throw the peppers, a tablespoon of the adobo sauce and the juice of the lime in a blender and blend until smooth
        4. Get a gallon ziplock baggie and place the chicken and marinade in
        5. Mix well and store in fridge overnight
- Allow chicken time out of the fridge before cooking. No longer than 30 minutes
    - Chicken will cook more evenly
### While cooking
- If cooking inside I like to use an oven safe pan so that I can sear the chicken then place directly in a 400 degree preheated oven to finish cooking through
- Let chicken go for at least 7 minutes before checking with a probe thermometer.
- Check chicken every 3-5 minutes after that until a probe thermometer reads 160 in the thickest part of the breast
### After the cook
- Let rest on a plate with a foil tent for at least 10 minutes
    - Allows the chicken to rest and reabsorb the juices
- Cut against the grain
