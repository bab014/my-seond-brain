#  Bible Time Week of July 28<sup>th</sup> - August 3<sup>rd</sup>

## Passage: [Matthew 20:1-16](https://www.esv.org/Matthew+20/)

**Matthew 20:16** *The last will be first, and the first last.*

It's important not to measure our worth by comparing it with the accomplishments of others.
> Comparison is the thief of joy

Am I comparing myself to others, or focusing on what God would have me focusing on?

### What should I be focused on
* More bible time
* More investment in the kids
* More investment in my marriage
* More investment in others

### Prayer
Feeling a bit like I'm at, not a cross-road, but an inflection point. The movie [Unsung Hero](https://www.lionsgate.com/movies/unsung-hero) really challenged me and was a beautiful picture of what I'd like our family's prayer life to look like. They prayed for everything and had a prayer board where they could see in real time their prayers being answered. I find it hard to lead like this. I'm not sure what my hang up is. Either feeling self-conscious about how it will be received or just sheer laziness. God I ask for the strength and the confidence to lead my family down the path you would have us go. I need to care more what you think of me than others, that includes my family. ***Give me the opportunities and humility to lead this way and to show my family how much I love them.*** One of the things I would like to do is start a prayer board like they do in the movie. What I am struggling with is that they had real physical needs, what are our physical needs? ***You have so immensely blessed us, Lord, show my family and I what we need to be praying for. If not something for ourselves, for others.***

### Follow Ups
- [ ] Start a prayer board
- [ ] 3 Bible times this week
- [ ] take the kids to the park and practice soccer/baseball
- [ ] Do a puzzle/game with Court and spend time asking her questions
- [ ] Text the guys in the LifeGroup individually and see how they're doing

## July 29<sup>th</sup>
### Passage: Matthew 13:31-32 *The Parable of the Mustard Seed*

The idea that something so small as a mustard seed, growing into something as a large as a fully grown tree is a good reminder of how small a faith can be but God can do amazing things with it and grow it large. So often I try to do things on my own, rely on my own abilities, this is forcing me to miss out on what God has for me. It feels like part lack of humility and sheer forgetfulness. Help me to remember, Lord, what you have for me is far greater than anything I can muster for myself. In your hands is life, and joy to the fullest. How easy I forget and rely on my abilities and lean on my wants. My prayer is that I take this serious, too often I let the world and life get in my way of truly seeing what you have for me and my family. Help me to be a better leader of my marriage and my family. <u>Help me to come to the end of myself, it is there where I will find **YOU**</u>.
