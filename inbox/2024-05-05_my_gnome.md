#  My Gnome

A video idea where I go over how I have my gnome set up.

## My Linux Journey
- First time using linux was through work
- Was learning python and AWS at the same time
- Was interested in learning more so I bought a `raspberry pi`
- Fell in love with the freedom and amount of choice
- Eventually settled on a window manager [Qtile](https://docs.qtile.org/en/stable/)

### Configuration Black Hole
- Window Managers are great, I prefer to have my windows auto tiled, much more ergonomic for my workflow
- **But**, I was spending hours configuring things to my exact liking and found my self in a *configuration black hole*
- The other things with Window Managers is that most things you will either need to have a way of doing things through the terminal or the ability to download an app to accomplish something.
- Because I lacked the skill to do this for some things, I was getting tripped up.
    1. Sound no longer worked since I needed to update the firmware
    2. Building out a session and using a `login manager`

### Gnome to the Rescue
- Got the idea to install ***Gnome*** side by side with my *Qtile* installation.
- I thought this might help my troubleshoot my audio issue mentioned above
- Turns out, I was right, Gnome alerted me that my firmware needed to be updated
- This got me thinking having people who know way more than me setup the desktop might be a good idea.
- I started working to configure ***Gnome*** to look and feel the way I need it to.
- I added a few extensions
    1. [Dash To Dock](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/307/dash-to-dock/) 
    2. [Forge - Auto tiles my windows](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4481/forge/) 
    3. [Space Bar - Shows me my workspaces](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5090/space-bar/) 
    4. [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/) 
- Using these I can just about replicate my Qtile experience but with the added benefit of all ***Gnome*** has to offer
