	Another morning in your presence Lord, thank you. I find myself getting too distracted while reading. Please take that from me. Focus my mind on you and what you are trying to teach me during my time with you. I find myself being too wrapped up in the cares of the this world, cares over things that you are in control of. Remind me of that fact. That you are in charge and control of my life and the lives of my family. My dad is causing so much frustration within the family and overall strife. Please, show him the error of his ways. Give me the words to speak and show me how to lead my family through this. I'm grateful for the example of how I don't want to be with my boys. Pride and ego suck the life out of everyone around it. Humility is how I am supposed to lead. It's not supposed to be about me. Let it always be about and for You. Let my boys see that as well. Grab hold of their hearts and let them know you intimately.
