	Another morning in your presence Lord. Thank you for this rich time in your word. My prayer is that you give me the grace and faith to withstand temptation. Holy Spirit speak through me, too easily I can lie and not speak with a kind heart. Quiet my heart today. 
	Let my words and actions be the examples my boys need to see you. I love them so much. Grab hold of my heart so that I might lead them to You. Don't let me take for granted this role you've blessed me with. The ability to be a Dad to these boys. Give me a heart of gratitude. Don't let me see this as a burden but a blessing. The chance to lead these boys to you. I can't do it on my own. I need you to guide me guiding them to you. I get in the way too much, I need to decrease in order for you to do what must be done in my life. Thank you Lord.
