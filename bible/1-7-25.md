	A quick morning as I am working out this morning. So not as much time in the word as I am used to. Speak to my heart this morning Lord. Although my time was short, let it be impactful. Let the Psalms and Proverb that I read be as real to me as when they were written. Please heal Court today. Give her a reprieve from feeling so sick. Let the boys listen well be easy for her today while I'm at work. 
	Let me be used at work in an impactful way. Quiet my heart and allow me to show others what it means to follow you.
