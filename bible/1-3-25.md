	Lord, too often I get caught up in what is going on in this world. I let it drive me instead of being focused on you in thought and prayer. I've allowed too many things to cloud my mind and distract me from what truly matters. Keep me focused on what you would have for me. Prayer is where I am to go to in all times, no matter the situation. That is how you would have me lead. By being a prayer leader. Teach me how to pray.
	Give me vision for our family and the faith to step out in it. The wisdom to see it and the means to accomplish the goals you have for us. Let this next year be one marked with consistency.
