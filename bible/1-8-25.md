	Lord, remind me of how active in my life you have been. You've been actively seeking my heart and too often I take that and You for granted. How can I expect my boys to see and cherish You if I do not? Teach me to cherish you, Holy Spirit shape my affections for God. Too easily my mind and heart go after things that don't matter.
	My dad has caused so much frustration in my family. Please Lord, show him how his actions have affected all of us. Bring him to a place where he can approach us and ask for forgiveness. Give me wisdom in dealing with this especially as it relates to Court and my boys. Also, I ask for peace over this situation. This has caused so much tension and frustration, I ask that peace would reign over our family and all of our hearts.
	Comfort Jeff and Sue as Jeff has his stent placed today. Be with the doctors and give them deft hands as they perform the procedure. Comfort Court and give her peace through the day as we wait to hear how everything went.
	Be with Beckett at school. Continue to grow him and allow him to find his voice. Grab hold of his heart Lord. Show me the dad you want me to be for these boys. I love them so much, let that translate into action.
